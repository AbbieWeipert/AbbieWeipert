<h1>CSS Exercise 3: Practice & Review </h1>
  <p style="border: 10px solid gold; margin: 10px 300px; padding: 20px; 
  text-align:center; font-size:40px;"> 
  Just like a spoken language, we will forget what we do not practice! With 
  all this hard work, it would be a shame to let it go. Practice makes perfect!

<h2>Practice Navigation Styling</h2>
<p>
On just this page, change the navigation bar so that it is sticky on the BOTTOM 
as your audience scrolls. Make sure it only changes this page and that all your
links continue to work as intended.

<h2>Style & Explain the CSS Box Model</h2>
<p>
The box model is something you will use over and over. It's critical to understand 
and utilize spacing for effective design. Use this space to describe the box model, 
insert an image that supports your written description, and include two examples 
where you have demonstrated the usefulness of spacing and what the box model can do.
Use subheaders like "h3" to organize your work and descriptions.
</p><br>

<h2>How to Insert CSS</h2>
<p>
Briefly define external, embedded, and inline CSS and where you would use each. Next,
utlize embedded CSS to style the background and font of a "div" element. The content
of "div" should be your description of where to insert CSS. Identify how the syntax 
changes when using inline versus embedded.
</p><br>
<hr />

<h2>Using Images & Text</h2>
<p>
Find any image that speaks to you and insert text in each corner and in the middle using 
a "div" element called "container" and a "div" element called "top-l", "top-r", "bottom-l" 
and so on to push a brief text into each corner and the middle. The image should utilize 
the full width of the screen but the image and text you use are totally up to you!
</p><br>
<hr />

<h2>Tables</h2>
<p>
Create a table of your schedule that covers at least 3 days. Merge 
cells as needed to cover multiple hours of the day. When the rows are hovered over, they 
should appear shaded. The column headers should be a different color than the cells. The 
width of the table should be 100%. Make sure it's stylish and not super lame.
</p><br>
<hr />

<h2>Impress Me!</h2>
<p>
You have covered a lot of ground these last weeks. Without Ms. Weipert dictating exactly 
what you must do, create a little mini page in this space that highlights some of what 
you have learned. You are free to be as creative as you can be! Be funny! Have fun!
