<h2>Combinators</h2>
There are four different combinators in CSS. Let's use "div" as an example:
    <ul><li>Descendant selector (space) - Selects all elements inside "div"</li>
    <li>Child selector (>) - Selects all elements that are immediate children of "div"</li>
    <li>Adjacent sibling selector (+) - Selects the next sibling of "div"</li>
    <li>General sibling selector (~) - Selects all following siblings of "div"</li></ul>

  <h4>Descendent Selector Example</h4>
  <div class="combdesc">
  In this "div" section I will create an example highlighting the descendent selector.
  All "p" within "div" should be highlighted as they are descendents of "div" regardless
  of being a direct child or further removed.
  <p>First paragraph in "div" </p>
  <p>Second paragraph in "div" </p>
  <strong><p>Third  paragraph in "div" that uses a "strong" HTML tag, too</p></strong>
  </div>
  
  <p> This text is an adjacent sibling to "div" but is NOT within "div"</p>

  <h4>Child Selector Example</h4>
  <div class="combchild">
  In this "div" section I will create an example highlighting the child selector.
  All "p" within "div" should be highlighted if they are a child of "div" but not if they are
  further removed.
  <p>First paragraph in "div" </p>
  <p>Second paragraph in "div" </p>
  <strong><p>Third  paragraph in "div" that uses a "strong" HTML tag, too. The "strong" tag
  further removes this "p" from "div" meaning it is no longer a child.</p></strong>
  </div>
  
  <p> This text is an adjacent sibling to "div" but is NOT within "div"</p>

  <h4>General Sibling Selector Example</h4>
  <div class="combgensib">
  In this "div" section I will create an example highlighting the child selector.
  All "p" within "div" should be highlighted if they are a child of "div" but not if they are
  further removed.
  <p>First paragraph in "div" </p>
  <p>Second paragraph in "div" </p>
  <strong><p>Third  paragraph in "div" that uses a "strong" HTML tag, too. The "strong" tag
  further removes this "p" from "div" meaning it is no longer a child.</p></strong>
  </div>
  
  <p> This text is an adjacent sibling to "div" but is NOT within "div"</p>
  <p> This is a second text as an adjacent sibling to "div" but is NOT within "div"
  both should be selected as siblings to "div".</p> <br>

<h2>Pseudo-Classes</h2>
Pseudo-classes can apply a special style to an element. Here are a couple of examples that I will
find useful as my web designs become more advanced and complex.
  <div> <h4>Do More with Links</h4>
  <p>
    Create an ordered list of 3 links that will open pages in a new tab. Set the color
    for visited links to "gold" while unvisited will be "white" and the background color 
    for hover to a light gray of your choice.
    <ol>
    <li><a href=https://www.tumblr.com/ target="_blank">Tumbled</a></li>
    <li><a href=https://www.instagram.com/?hl=en target="_blank">Insta My Gram</a></li>
    <li><a href=https://twitter.com/?lang=en target="_blank">Tweetered</a></li></ol>
  </p>
  
  <h4>Call Attention with Tooltip Hover</h4>
  <div class="joke1"> Find a joke (keep it PG, people!) and prompt the user to hover over the joke intro
  in order to display the punchline.<br> <br>
  <strong>How do you make a Kleenex dance?</strong>
  <p class="joke2">Put a little boogie in it!</p>
  </div></div><br>
  <hr />


<h2>Pseudo-Elements</h2>
Pseudo-elements allows the application of style to selections of the whole element. I will
show you how this might come in handy with a couple of examples.<br><br><br>

  <h4>Framing Pseudo-Elements</h4>
  <div><p>
  Let's say you are managing a website that provides instructional content for your target audience. Let's 
  say it teaches the audience how to do something while also providing important details and context. All 
  that extra info is important, but your primary goal was the how-to function so you want to attract extra 
  attention to the instructions. Add three brief paragraphs here.<br><br>
  The first paragraph should be a step-by-step instruction. The second paragraph should be some additional 
  and supporting information, but not necessary to actually complete the task. The third paragraph will be 
  another part of the how-to instruction. Call attention to those instructions by inserting the beegif 
  image before and after the relevant elements.
  </p>
  <p class="bee" style="color: gold">First, it is critical to detail out the purpose and goal of your 
  website. Second, you will want to narrow down exactly who your target audience is.
  </p>
  <p>Without knowing who your target audience is, the scope of your design and coding will feel 
  umanageable. You will be trying to please EVERYONE and ultimately pleasing NONE because the content and 
  design will just be far too generic. This is an important step that should not be skipped.
  </p>
  <p class="bee" style="color: gold">Now that you have the purpose, goal, and target audience defined 
  get out and do some fact checking. Do members of your target audience actually have a need that your 
  website fulfills? 
  </p>
  </div><br><br>

  <h4>Styling Partial Elements</h4>
  <div><p class="pseudocolor">
  There may be times I want to call special attention to the start of a paragraph, such as when I change
  topics or introduce new concepts. Here, I have included an example of changing the first letter of 
  this paragraph to an "extra-large" size as well as changing the color to help it stand out. For this 
  last sentence I'm basically adding some length to ensure the paragraph wraps onto multiple lines. I 
  really want my formatting of that first paragraph line to jump out at my audience. Where do you think
  this might be useful in your own design? How will you use it?
  </p></div><br>

<h2>Opacity</h2>
Insert the saltbae.jpg image with an opacity of 0.35 but remove the transparency when
the user hoves the mouse over Salt Bae. Let his glory shine through uninhibited. Seeking
user interaction on your website might hold their attention longer and could prove to be
a useful tool. Used too much and you can see how it could become annoying.
  <img class="salt" src="images/saltbae.jpg" width=15%>
  <br>

<hr>
<h2>Attribute Selectors</h2>
There may be times where attention should be called to displayed items to emphasize them 
or to differentiate those items from others in a similar display frame. For example, 
here are 4 memes where I wanted to highlight that I really liked two of them
by giving them a green border. Let's be honest. I liked them ALL! But if I had to pick two...
  <img src="images/obamabiden.png" title="Biden is Amazing">
  <img src="images/thinkin.jpg" title="Thinkin Dude is okay">
  <img src="images/bfmeme.jpeg" title="Distracted Boyfriend is Amazing">
  <img src="images/blinky.gif" title="Blinky is okay">

<hr />

<br />
<div><h2>Whew!</h2>
  That stuff was kind of dry. Here is a selfie of my "accomplished" face 
  for you to enjoy. You deserve a fun break, too, after all that learning! Better
  include that green ring so you know it's a good one.<br>
  (Insert your meme here)
  <img src="images/selfiememe.jpg" title="My Selfie is Amazing">
</div>
