  Just like a spoken language, we will forget what we do not practice! With 
  all this hard work, it would be a shame to let it go. Practice makes perfect!

<h2>Practice Navigation Styling</h2>
<p>
On just this page, change the navigation bar so that it is sticky on the BOTTOM 
as your audience scrolls. Make sure it only changes this page and that all your
links continue to work as intended.
</p>

<h4>ANSWER</h4> 
<p class="ans">The nav bar is not only moved to the bottom but I removed the margin-top:20px,
from the body tag in the styleabbie.css file to remove the spacing at the top, and replaced
it with a margin-bottom: 40px to make room for the bar at the bottom.

<h2>Style & Explain the CSS Box Model</h2>
<p>
The box model is something you will use over and over. It's critical to understand 
and utilize spacing for effective design. Use this space to describe the box model, 
insert an image that supports your written description, and include two examples 
where you have demonstrated the usefulness of spacing and what the box model can do.
Use subheaders like "h3" to organize your work and descriptions. 

</p>

<h4>ANSWER</h4> 
<p class="ans">The CSS Box Model says that all HTML elements can be considered boxes 
and we can apply style and design to those boxes. Each box has a margin, a border, 
some padding, and then the content of the HTML element. You can use the 
box model to make sure elements are properly sized and spaced to create the style 
and design aesthetic you are going for. <br><br>

Here is one example:<br>
<img src=images/boxmod.png alt="Box Model">
<div class="boxmod">
The Box Model image from W3schools.com above is 428px wide. This content is within 
a box that is also 199px wide, no matter how big your screen or browser window is. 
This ensures my image and paragraph elements always have a similar style.
<ul>
<li>Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear</li>
<li>Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent</li>
<li>Border - A border that goes around the padding and content</li>
<li>Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Insert CSS</h2>
<p>
Briefly define external, embedded, and inline CSS and where you would use each. Next,
utlize embedded CSS to style the background and font of a "div" element. The content
of "div" should be your description of where to insert CSS. Identify how the syntax 
changes when using inline versus embedded.
</p>

<h4>ANSWER</h4> 
<p class="ans">
<div class="insertcss">
CSS can be inserted into our webpages in a few different ways:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Inline Styles: </strong>Use within the HTML tag to apply unique style to a single 
  element. Use sparingly as you lose the efficiency advantages to other CSS usage types. 
  If you use this method, Internal and External CSS applications will be ignored.</li>

  <li><strong>Internal CSS: </strong>When CSS coding is embedded in the "head" section of the HTML 
  document, this is called Internal CSS. Use this when you have specific style that 
  only applies to the one page. Again, try to use sparingly as you will have to 
  maintain this style within this .html doc specifically.</li>

  <li><strong>External Style Sheet: </strong>Here is where most of your styling will occur. This 
  is the most efficient way to manage style that applies to an entire website and all its subpages. 
  Make one change in the external styles.css sheet and it will apply to your whole site!</li>

  <li><strong>Browser Defaults: </strong>Last but not least, the browser will fall back to its
  defaults if you do not declare other styles using one of the prior three methods.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Using Images & Text</h2>
<p>
Find any image that speaks to you and insert text in each corner and in the middle using 
a "div" element called "container" and a "div" element called "top-l", "top-r", "bottom-l" 
and so on to push a brief text into each corner and the middle. The image should utilize 
the full width of the screen but the image and text you use are totally up to you!
</p>

<h4>ANSWER</h4> 
<p class="ans">The below image of Salt Bae demonstrates the usage of a container for 
text pushed around within that container. Enjoy!
</p><br>

<div class="container">
  <img src="images/saltbae.jpg" alt="Sale Bae" style="width:100%;">
  <div class="top-l" style="font-size:40px">Sale Bae</div>
  <div class="top-r" style="font-size:40px">is the</div>
  <div class="bottom-r" style="font-size:40px">deny it!</div>
  <div class="bottom-l" style="font-size:40px">and don't you</div>
  <div class="middle" style="font-size:90px; color:gold;"><strong>BEST BAE</strong></div>
</div>

<h2>Tables</h2>
<p>
Create a table of your schedule that covers at least 3 days. Merge 
cells as needed to cover multiple hours of the day. When the rows are hovered over, they 
should appear shaded. The column headers should be a different color than the cells. The 
width of the table should be 100%. Make sure it's stylish and not super lame.
</p>

<h4>ANSWER</h4> 
<p class="ans">I did not fully fill out my table but I think you'll get the gist of how 
you can populate, style, and add value to your webpage using tables.

<table id="schedule">
  <tr>
    <th>Time</th>
    <th>Monday</th>
    <th>Tuesday</th>
    <th>Wednesday</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Early Morning</td>
    <td rowspan="2">Slept in!</td>
    <td>5:30 Wake Up</td>
    <td>5:30 again :(</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mid-Morning</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Lunch</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Eary Afternoon</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Late Afternoon</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Evening</td>
    <td></td>
    <td rowspan="2">So tired...</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bedtime</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>
