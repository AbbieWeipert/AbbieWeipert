<h1>CSS Exercise 3: Through Attribute Selectors</h1>

<p>Exercise three is the <strong>halfway point</strong> through CSS tutorials!
  This is the third demonstration of all my new skills. Since I've been getting into
  more abstract and functional coding I want to make sure my style skills are still
  sharp. I'll be reviewing some previous lessons as well as highlighting new technique.</p>

<p>Thus far, I have carefully made my way through tutorials and exercises covering:
  <ul style="margin: 20px 60px; list-style-type: circle;">
    <li>Combinators</li>
    <li>Pseudo-Classes</li>
    <li>Pseudo-Elements</li>
    <li>Opacity</li>
    <li>Attribute Selectors</li>
  </ul>
  Working with combinators, classes, and elements was a little more abstract than the concrete
  styling of text, images, links, and backgrounds. Opacity felt a little more practical and I
  can see how attribute selectors will be very helpful as my designs grow more complex.

<h2> Using Google Fonts </h2>
  <p>
  As a demonstration of utilizing both HTML and CSS languages, I have used both languages to select 
  two Google Fonts for body content and a separate one for the various headers. I have also adjusted 
  the font-size and font-weight for readability and style. It felt really satisfying to figure out 
  how to utilize two different Google Fonts on one page. <br><br>(Copy and paste your code here using the "code"
  HTML and assign each font, 2 minimum, to a different elements on this page. The trick is display HTML
  code as actual page contnet. You might have to do a little research!)<br><br>

<code>
  &lt;! -- ==== Using a Google Font is easy. Reference the font with HTML first. ==== --&gt;<br />
  &lt;link href="Ms. W is withholding a few hints here" rel="stylesheet"&gt;<br />
  <br />
  /* ==== Pull in the fonts referenced in HTML using CSS like this ==== */ <br>
  h1, h2, h3, h4 { <br>
   Ms. W is withholding a few hints here; <br>
   }<br>
  <br>
   body {<br>
    Ms. W is withholding a few hints here;<br>
   }   <br>
</code>
